# Interest-Calculator
A simple intrest rate calculator, useful for calculating a final account value based on variable monthly contributions and a constant interest rate. Uncertainty in interest rate can also be taken into account and the final values can be compared to the scenario where the interest is zero.

There is also a simulation function where a real life aproxiamtion is simulated with the use of a geometric brownian motion model. In a monte carlo style method the simulation is then ran many times to generate a PDF for final value outcomes.
